# Airport Flight Managment System  (Grade: 18.9 / 20)

A project was done in one month with @goncaloremelhe and @tomaspm05.
Air transport is a crucial element in global connectivity, influencing mobility, trade, and cultural interactions. To enhance the understanding and planning of the complex flight network, this 
project aims to develop a comprehensive flight management system for airlines worldwide. The system will assist users in exploring and planning travel efficiently, providing relevant information 
in an intuitive and accessible manner.

Statement of Work
In this project, the following tasks are to be accomplished:

- [x] Data Parsing: Read and parse the given data into appropriate data structures using Graph's.
- [x] Network Statistics: Calculate and list essential statistics for the air travel network, covering airport-specific flight and airline details, available and reachable destinations from airports, top airports by air traffic capacity, and identification of essential airports for network circulation.
- [x] Best Flight Option: Present the best flight option(s) for a given source and destination, considering the least amount of stops. Allow user specification using airport code or name, city name, or geographical coordinates.
- [x] Filtered Flight Search: Search for the best flight option with filters respecting user preferences, such as specific airlines or minimizing the number of different airlines in the travel.
- [x] Documentation: Include documentation for relevant functions using Doxygen, indicating the time complexity of the most relevant functions or algorithms.
